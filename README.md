This is Bisipariş versıon 1.0 alpha 4.

This project includes:
- Backend web application, using ASP.NET Core 3.0 Razor Pages.
- A group of web services, using ASP.NET Core 3.0 Web API.
- A mobile application, using Xamarin Forms 4.0.

The Bisipariş project helps anyone to order food from any restaurant; such that the restaurant prepares the ordered food 
**while the customer is on way** to the restaurant.

Tıll now, almost all of the entities (and their properties) have been coded.
About half of the functionality (i.e. use cases) of the web backend had been coded.

Coding the mobile app has not started yet. It is expected to start soon.
